# Todo List Web App

Welcome! This repository is a simple, responsive Todo List app created using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 4), and pure JavaScript. It lets you easily manage your daily tasks—add new todos, mark them as complete, delete with a click, and save automatically in your browser using local storage.

## Features

- "Add Tasks" : Enter text, hit "Add", and your new todo appears immediately.
- "Complete Tasks" :Check a box to mark a task finished—the item will show a strikethrough.
- "Delete Tasks" : Click the trash icon next to any task to remove it.
- "Save Tasks" : Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close or refresh the page.
- "Responsive Design" : Built with Bootstrap to look great on desktops and mobile devices.
- "Simple User Experience" : Intuitive layout with clear buttons and helpful headings.

## How It Works

- Type your todo in the input box and click "Add".
- Mark completed tasks with the checkbox—they’ll show as crossed out.
- Delete tasks by clicking the trash can icon.
- Click "Save" to manually store tasks, though your todos auto-save in the background.
- Reload the page anytime; your list remains intact!
